# Exercise Instruction

Catalyte wants to build a simple application to help associates track common tasks
they work on during the training cycle. An associate should be able to select from a list
of tasks to add to their TODO list. Once the task is completed, it should be removed
from the TODO list.

# Requirements

1. The application should display a list of at least 8 possible tasks for associates to
   choose from (ex. Daily Standup).
2. Selecting a task should add a copy of the task to the associate's TODO list.
3. Associates should be able to complete a task on their TODO list, which removes
   it from the TODO list.
4. Application should be broken down into multiple, logical components, stored in
   separate files.
5. Component state should be updated immutably

# Stretch Requirements

1. Create a way for associates to enter and add their own tasks, which will be added
   to the list of possible task options to choose from.
